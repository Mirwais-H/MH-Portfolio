                            Hi there! My name is Mirwais Hamidi, and I'm a high school sophomore with a deep passion for designing and programming. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the world of technology and the endless possibilities it offers.

                        <p>
                            My journey into the realm of coding began with small projects, and over time, I've honed my skills and taken on more complex challenges. I find joy in creating interactive and engaging experiences, whether it's through a simple web page or an intricate game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from my technical pursuits, I enjoy collaborating with others and learning from the vast community of developers. I believe that sharing knowledge and working together can lead to amazing innovations.
                        </p>
                        <p>

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a professional setting.
